Seattle](https://www.nwchoirs.org/vocalpoint-seattle) while in secondary school. He also studied music composition and theory while earning a B.A. in Chemistry at [Goucher College](https://www.goucher.edu), and performed in, arranged for, and directed multiple student-run ensembles. Dr. Rees later performed with Seattle soul and R&B group [The Freams](https://www.facebook.com/freamsband/), and currently plays keyboard and trumpet with blues/funk/rock group [Controlled Burn](https://www.facebook.com/ControlledBurnTheBand/) in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Dr. Rees has M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemistry from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu), which included substantial technical training in wave physics and signal processing. His approach to sound engineering blends this scientific expertise with a disciplined ear and musicianship spanning an extensive range of genres.
