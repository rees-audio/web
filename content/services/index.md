Rees Audio Engineering provides a range of audio and sound design and engineering services for artists and ensembles of all sorts. We are happy to work with you through either the entire production and creation process, or just selected phases.

<h3>Choirs and Vocal Ensembles</h3>

Julian builds on a decade of rigorous training in choral musicianship, and understands the nuance and precision expected from world-class choirs. For multitracked recordings, his meticulous editing of pitch, transients, and formants results in a polished and professional choral sound, and he uses a variety of algorithmic and convolution reverb tools to place choirs into concert halls, cathedrals, and other performance spaces. Julian is also available for limited on-site recording projects, virtual consultation, and remote audio engineering.



<h3>Solo Artists, Small Groups, and Bands</h3>

Julian has been playing music and producing his own projects for years, and enjoys meeting and collaborating with new artists. An avid listener of genres including Motown and soul, funk, R&B, hip hop, classical, EDM, pop, and folk / country, he is happy to offer creative insight for new projects or to simply provide technical expertise and engineering for your vision.
